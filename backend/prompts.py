    Your task is to analyze the merge conflict, understand the changes from both sides, and suggest the best resolution strategy.
    
    For each conflict, you should:
    1. Identify the nature of the conflict (e.g., functionality changes, formatting, refactoring)
    2. Analyze both versions of the code to understand their purpose
    3. Identify which parts from each version should be kept
    4. Suggest a clean, complete resolution that preserves the intent of both changes when possible
    5. Explain your reasoning clearly
    
    When analyzing code conflicts, pay attention to:
    - Function/method signatures and their implementation
    - Variable declarations and their usage
    - API contracts and their implementations
    - Import statements and dependencies
    - Code style and formatting conventions

    1. CONFLICT ANALYSIS: Briefly explain what each side is trying to do
    2. RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Suggest whether to keep our version, their version, or create a custom resolution
    3. PROPOSED RESOLUTION: Provide the exact code that should replace the conflict markers
    4. EXPLANATION: Explain why your resolution is appropriate
